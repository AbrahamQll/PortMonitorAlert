# PortMonitorAlert
Using this tool for windows you can basically monitor all TCP open ports and see if anyone tries to connect to them, you would receive an alert letting you know that someone is trying to access that port.

⚠️ This tool is not even in beta or alpha phase yet. There is a lot to add to this tool. And also do not use this in highly sensitive environments. ⚠️


## Plans for future 
Addition of UDP monitoring
